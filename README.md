# Distracted-Driver-Detection
The Data is provided by State Farm on Kaggle (Click the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection) )

Given a dataset of 2D dashboard camera images from State Farm, we need to classify driver's behavior. Are they driving attentively, wearing their seatbelt, or taking a selfie with their friends in the backseat

Applied dense layer model, made a CNN architecture then applied varrious data augmentation for enhancing the performance and finally applied transfer learning for boosting the performance.

- But when test all model on the Test set tje Tranfed Learning Model has the lowest error value
